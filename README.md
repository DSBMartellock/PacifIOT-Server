# PacifIOT-Server
The main data collection/inbetween for the pacifIOT project. Completed for RIT senior design. 

Im a mechanical engineer, its a bit hacky, cut me some slack!

Connects to our Microcontroller on the baby jumper, and watches for any changes in the data being broadcast to it over BLE.
Compares the data gotten from BLE to a yaml file. 
Posts all of the data to a web page which was then parsed by a simple android application.
